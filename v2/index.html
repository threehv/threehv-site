              <h2>Web-site development</h2>
              <p>Your web-site, built to order, on a predictable schedule, according to your specification for a known price.  3hv has experience in requirements gathering, knowledge of how to manage a project whilst the work is in progress and great support skills to keep you up and running after completion.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Ruby &amp; Ruby on Rails</h2>
              <p>Ruby, the programming language, is extremely expressive and capable of achieving great results in a very short amount of time.  </p>
              <p>Ruby on Rails builds upon this, allowing the quick, reliable development of database-backed web-sites with a minimum of hassle.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Communications</h2>
              <p>Projects need great communications.  No technical jargon, just plain english and everything tracked through a dedicated project management web-site.  All communications are centralised, with everyone involved given access as needed, ensuring that we are all on the same page.  
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Automated testing</h2>
              <p>Every piece of work has a specification written and agreed upon before development begins.  This description of the behaviour of your site is then automatically tested as work progresses, so you always know how much is outstanding and have a guarantee that what is there works.  In fact, this "behaviour-driven development" can produce code that is <em>virtually bug-free</em>.

He's also a great communicator, keeping us in the loop - critical when working remotely. He couldn't be better if he was made out of pizza and pooped diamonds."</blockquote>

The enthusiasm he has combined with the ability to work with colleagues, customers &amp; management make him an absolute asset to any company as an employee, consultant or partner. I highly recommend him."  </blockquote>
