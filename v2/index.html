He's also a great communicator, keeping us in the loop - critical when working remotely. He couldn't be better if he was made out of pizza and pooped diamonds."</blockquote>

The enthusiasm he has combined with the ability to work with colleagues, customers &amp; management make him an absolute asset to any company as an employee, consultant or partner. I highly recommend him."  </blockquote>
