              <h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
              <p>
                3hv (managed by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rahoulbaruah">Rahoul Baruah</a> with a team of expert associates), specialises in software development using <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> - an environment for building web-sites using industry-standard best practice.  
              </p>
              <p>
                With Rails experience dating back to 2005 (ages in internet time) and extensive understanding of object-oriented development, database design and easy to use interfaces, we build reliable, scalable sites that do what you need them to do.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Prices depend upon the nature of the project at hand but is normally in the &pound;300/day region.  Get in touch to find out more.

            <li>
              <h2>Web Sites</h2>
              <p>
                Using powerful open source software, such as the ubiquitous <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> we can host and configure a small web-site that you can manage yourself.  We provide the software, manuals and the hosting, you provide the ideas and the domain name (web address).
              </p>
              <p>
                Prices start from &pound;200 for the first year (for setup and hosting), with subsequent years costing &pound;50 (hosting). There is a huge selection of free templates that can be adapted for your needs; or we can design one from scratch for you if your requirements are more specialised.  
              </p>
            </li>

              <h2>Consultancy</h2>
              <p>
                While Ruby on Rails encourages best practice, there are still a number of common pitfalls that befall even the best developers.  Our extensive experience means we have seen most of these before and can offer quick and easy pointers to improve your code's structure, reliability and scalability.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Submit your Rails project for consultancy (in full confidence) and within ten working days you will receive a detailed report on the state of your project. This will be split into three sections - things that require immediate attention, warnings and danger signs and things that have been done well. Each issue will have a detailed explanation and recommendation for improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perfect for putting manager's minds at ease, and also great for assisting novice Rails developers learn best-practice, the Rails Consultancy starts at &pound;1000.

He's also a great communicator, keeping us in the loop - critical when working remotely. He couldn't be better if he was made out of pizza and pooped diamonds."</blockquote>
