= The 3hv Website. 

The purpose of this web-site is to demonstrate my design capabilities, sell the business and potentially serve as the foundation of a custom CMS.  

= The Home Page

The home page should have a large 3hv logo, a large label stating "Software Development" and then small links for "ruby on rails", "about", "contact", "blog" and "articles".
